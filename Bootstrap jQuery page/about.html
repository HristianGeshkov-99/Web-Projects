            Our all-time favourite angry rap god and outright master of the
            English dictionary Marshall Mathers, has been known to throw down
            some incredible lines of craft in his songs. Zero-in on the lyrical
            genius behind your favourite Eminem tracks and you’ll notice those
            soundbites that stand out so courageously in a world where words are
            always so beautifully filtered. Eminem’s not one of those artists
            you just listen to cause it’s vibey. (Nothing against that kind of
            genre – I certainly don’t mind the songs on my playlist which are
            lucky to even attain even one lyric). Eminem is a beyond talented
            poet with a talent to cut through the mediocre with a chainsaw. He’s
            a writer, a wordsmith and a visionary – always searching for the
            perfect arrangement of the alphabet that gets across his innermost
            thoughts, past experiences and pain.

            Rapper, actor and music producer Eminem is one of the best-selling
            musicians of the 21st century and one of the most influential
            rappers of all time. Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in 1972 in
            Missouri, Eminem had a turbulent childhood. He dropped out of school
            in the ninth grade and worked odd jobs until finally making it as a
            rapper upon the release of The Slim Shady LP in early 1999. The
            album went multi-platinum, garnering Eminem two Grammy Awards and
            four MTV Video Music Awards. In 2000, Eminem released The Marshall
            Mathers LP, which was noted as the fastest-selling album in rap
            history. Two years later, he delivered the Academy Award-winning
            song "Lose Yourself," from the semi-autobiographical drama 8 Mile.
            In 2010, he released the Grammy-winning album Recovery, a highly
            autobiographical attempt to come to terms with his struggles with
            addiction and experience with rehabilitation. The Marshall Mathers
            LP 2 (2013) also garnered numerous accolades, and the rapper later
            followed with Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be
            Murdered By (2020). Eminem's Mom and Dad

            Eminem has been scrutinized, both as a rapper and personality-wise.
            He was twice married to Kimberly Anne Scott; he met Scott in high
            school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool
            J's "I'm Bad". Scott and her twin sister Dawn had run away from
            home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15 and he
            began an on-and-off relationship with Scott in 1989. Mathers and
            Scott were married in 1999 and divorced in 2001. Although Eminem
            told Rolling Stone in 2002, "I would rather have a baby through my
            penis than get married again", he and Scott briefly remarried in
            January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint
            custody of Hailie. Their daughter, Hailie Jade is a social media
            influencer, specifically for fashion and beauty. Eminem was given
            custody of his ex-sister-in-law Dawn's daughter, Scott's child from
            another relationship, and his younger half-brother Nathan. In early
            2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed
            their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his
            representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly
            relationship. In his 2013 song "Headlights", Eminem apologized to
            and reiterated his love for his mother.
